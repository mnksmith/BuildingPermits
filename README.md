# Building Permits
Text analysis of Boston building permits data

See the [Ipython notebook](https://github.com/mnksmith/BuildingPermits/blob/main/Building_Permits_Processing.ipynb) for a detailed description of the thought process behind this NLP analysis. The analysis features the nltk and textblob packages, as well as count vectorization using sklearn.

A sampled portion of the full dataset can be found in the data folder. The data originated from the [Boston Open Data Portal](https://data.boston.gov/dataset/approved-building-permits)
